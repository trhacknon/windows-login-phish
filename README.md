# How to use ?
Within the directory there are 2 files by the name of:
  - AttackersSetup(windows).exe
  - AttackerSetup4linux (see images below)  
  
As per your OS, either **Windows or Linux**, execute the appropriate AttackerSetup program, that's it.
Note: *Tested and works on on both windows and linux platform.*

#### Scenario would be like...
- Run the **setup** and the program will **automatically** host the required files.
- Once the program shows the active URL and `[READY!]`, then secretly go to the victim's computer when he is distracted.
- Open **victim's browser** and put in the **URL(shown in the setup)** and use **F11 for fullscreen**. Viola! Now the lockscreen page will appear.
- Go back to your setup program and just wait for the victim to put in his credentials. When he does, the username and password will be displayed in the console. 
- Note: *logs.txt file is created with the data saved from console.*
